# Black 2006 Recomp

An experimental native Windows recompilation of the original Xbox release of
**BLACK (2006)**, built with XboxRecomp. It includes a Direct3D 11 renderer,
keyboard and mouse controls, XInput controller support, video settings, a PC
launcher, and native audio output. Movies are enabled by default.

Startup logos skip on one press of Escape, Enter, Space, left click, or controller
A / B / Start. During a cutscene, the first press shows **Press again to skip**
in the bottom-right corner. Release and press again within three seconds to skip;
holding a button cannot confirm. The hint also works with native menus disabled
and stays at the window corner on ultrawide displays. Looping menu backgrounds
keep playing normally. See the [movie skip tests](tests/movie_skip/README.md).

Ambient occlusion adds contact shading from scene depth with **SSAO Classic,
HBAO, HBAO+, and GTAO**, each with Low, Medium, High, and Ultra quality. Choose
the method and quality on the launcher's **Graphics** tab or the in-game
**Video Settings > Graphics** page. AO defaults to **Off**, with **High** quality
selected for when it is enabled. The launcher's labels and help follow the
selected menu language. The in-game **Video Settings > Graphics** page also
localizes its tabs, setting names, values, and help text between English and
Brazilian Portuguese.

These are local implementations of the techniques; HBAO+ does not use the
vendor SDK. The [AO regression tests](tests/ambient_occlusion/README.md) exercise
the actual shaders, settings, launcher controls, and native camera hook without
game files.

Launch through the first mission has been tested, including the opening movies,
mission briefing, movement, shooting, and reloading with audio. This is still a
work in progress: later missions are unverified, crashes and rendering issues
remain possible, and Xbox GP/EP audio effects are not fully emulated.

Gameplay voices and effects now honor their source sample rate at the 48 kHz
audio output. This corrects 32 kHz speech playing about 50% too fast and high.
The [APU regression test](tests/apu_pitch/README.md) checks pitch, duration,
stream completion, and playback lifecycle without game files or an audio device.

This repository contains host source and build tooling. **You must supply your
own original Xbox game files.** Game assets, the XBE, generated game-function
bodies, recordings, and prebuilt executables are excluded.

## Build

Requirements:

- Windows x64, an AVX2-capable CPU, and a Direct3D 11 graphics device.
- Visual Studio 2022 with **Desktop development with C++** and a Windows SDK.
- Git, CMake 3.20 or newer, and Python 3.10 or newer (`py -3`).
- Rustup with the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` toolchain (the pinned DSP build uses Rust 1.98.1).
- The supported retail original Xbox release of BLACK, extracted into `game/`.

The supported `game/default.xbe` has SHA-256:

```text
DF2739C372D254A90AEECCF5971D12097F22D89FBB90DB021FDA96DD4DEB68F6
```

Keep the extracted disc layout intact, including `GlobData.bin`, `levels/`,
`sound/`, and `videos/`. Other releases and the PlayStation 2 version are not
supported by this build.

From PowerShell in this repository:

```powershell
.\scripts\setup.ps1
.\'BLACK PC Launcher.exe'
```

Setup fetches pinned XboxRecomp and DSP56300 revisions, applies the included
runtime patch, creates a local Python environment, generates code from your XBE,
and builds the game and launcher. These dependencies and outputs stay outside Git.
Building the generated C code can take several minutes.

Use the launcher to configure controls and video settings, then choose **Play**.
Leave **Skip movies** and **Advance startup menus automatically** unchecked to
watch the full opening and navigate manually. Local settings live in `local/`,
saves in `save/`, and diagnostic logs in `reports/`. Close the game before
removing the project folder; retain `save/` if you want to keep your progress.

The launcher's **Game > Menu language** setting chooses English or Brazilian
Portuguese for both the launcher and game, and is saved in
`local/xbox-launcher.json`. Before each run, the launcher installs the selected
bank at `game/language/strings/MainUS.bin` and passes that language to the game.
Keep the source banks at `local/language-banks/en-US/MainUS.bin` and
`local/language-banks/pt-BR/MainUS.bin`; `local/` is excluded from Git. The
launcher defaults to English when the setting is new or invalid.

The opening cutscene subtitles are in `subtitles/03_N.srt` (English) and
`subtitles/pt-BR/03_N.srt` (Brazilian Portuguese). The runtime selects the file
from the launcher language. Supply the corresponding audio/game files yourself.

AO requires the GPU renderer. Every quality uses a full-resolution R8 mask and
depth-aware blur; higher quality increases sampling density and radius. AO
multiplies scene color before depth of field, FXAA, sharpening, and the HUD.
It uses the world camera's current half-frustum, captured with each queued draw
so asynchronous rendering keeps the correct camera. Missing camera data or an
incompatible depth surface bypasses the effect. Depth reconstruction uses a
calibrated approximation, and HUD separation follows the existing depth-state
heuristic. First-mission HBAO+ High and AO Off were checked in gameplay; later
missions remain unverified.

Saved video settings use `ao_method=off|ssao|hbao|hbao_plus|gtao` and
`ao_quality=low|medium|high|ultra`. `RECOMP_AO_METHOD` and `RECOMP_AO_QUALITY`
override and lock their respective controls for that run. Legacy `ssao` and
`RECOMP_SSAO` settings remain supported. Untouched older default menu layouts
upgrade to include both AO controls; customized layouts are preserved.
