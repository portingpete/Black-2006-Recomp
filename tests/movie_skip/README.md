# Movie skip regression

These focused Windows tests compile the patched production movie input and
overlay sources, plus the authored BLACK wrapper in `src/recomp_manual.c`.
They need no game files, generated guest code, display, controller or saved game.

```powershell
cmake -S tests/movie_skip -B build-movie-skip -A x64
foreach ($configuration in 'Release', 'Debug') {
    cmake --build build-movie-skip --config $configuration
    ctest --test-dir build-movie-skip -C $configuration --output-on-failure
}
```

The default runtime path is `third_party/xboxrecomp`. Override it with
`-DXBOXRECOMP_DIR=<absolute pinned, patched checkout>` for another checkout.
The `Movie skip regression` workflow checks out the pinned runtime, verifies and
applies the repository patch, builds the production `xbox_video` and `xbox_input`
libraries, then runs all three regressions in Release and Debug.

- `movie-input` exercises Escape, Enter, Space, controller A/B/Start and left
  mouse: one-press startup skip, released second-press cutscene confirmation,
  repeat/hold rejection, timeout, session replacement, stale requests, end of
  movie, filter priority, report neutralization and focus loss/return. Physical
  and scripted mouse releases held across a transition must not leak menu taps.
  A synthetic resolver explicitly disables gameplay action mapping; no game
  control-map table is copied into the fixture.
- `movie-overlay` supplies a one-texel synthetic font and tiny in-memory page to
  the production `pc_menu.c`. It checks safe margins, brightness, premultiplied
  alpha, letterboxing, ultrawide placement, resize, unchanged-pixel caching,
  invalidation, composition and exact restoration of cached page pixels.
  Unrelated video settings and input services stay inactive through small
  harness stubs, without loading retail assets or writing settings files.
- `movie-wrapper` uses synthetic guest memory and a pump stub to check logo and
  cutscene classification, ownership, EOF, reopen, decoder replacement, looping
  exclusion, the lab skip variable, stale requests, bounded names, guest registers,
  stack return and floating-point state. CMake derives the wrapper and font
  helper directly from the current production source into the build directory;
  no extracted `.inc` copies are published. Assertions remain enabled in Release,
  and the harness rejects a build with `NDEBUG` still defined.

These regressions verify input/state/rendering contracts. They do not substitute
for playback and skip-transition checks using the user's own retail installation.
